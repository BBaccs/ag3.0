                            fulfill a CCPA request unless we
                            have been provided sufficient information for us to reasonably verify the identity of the
                            requestor and the validity of the request.

                        <p>Some PI we maintain about Consumers (e.g., clickstream data) is not sufficiently associated with
                            enough PI about the Consumer for us to be able
                            to verify that it is a particular Consumer’s PI. Accordingly, we will not include such
                            information in response to Consumer requests. If we
                            cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response. You are not required
                            to create an account with us to make a
                            verifiable request, but you may use your account to do so. We will use PI provided in your
                            request to verify your identity or authority
                            to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also provided the PI
                            to us for another purpose.

                        <p>While there is not yet a consensus, data practices of third-party cookies and tracking
                            technologies associated with our websites and mobile app
                            may constitute a “Sale” of your PI as defined by the CCPA. You can exercise control over
                            browser-based cookies by adjusting the settings on
                            your browser, and mobile devices may offer ad limitation choices. In addition, third party tools
                            may enable you to search for and opt-out of
                            some of these trackers, such as the Ghostery browser plug-in available at <a

                            regarding certain kinds of online interest-based advertising in our privacy policy. We do not
                            represent that these third party tools, programs
                            or statements are complete or accurate, clearing cookies or changing settings may affect your
                            choices and you may have to opt-out separately via
                            each browser and other device you use.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as do not track signals, but we do not
                            understand them to operate in that manner or to
                            represent a “do not sell” request by you; accordingly, currently we do not view these signals as
                            a do not sell request. We understand that
                            various parties are developing do not sell signals and we may recognize certain such signals if
                            we conclude such a program is appropriate.
                        </p>
                        <p>We do not knowingly Sell the PI of Consumers. All consumers, regardless of age, may opt out of

                        <p>Except to the extent we have a basis for retention under CCPA, you may request that we delete
                            your PI that we have collected directly from you and are maintaining. Our retention rights
                            include, without limitation, to complete transactions and service you have requested, for
                            security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, including maintaining business
                            records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law
                            enforcement</p>
                        <h2 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Non-Discrimination and Financial Incentive Programs</h2>
                        <p>We will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your
                            CCPA rights. However, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or
                            quality of goods or services, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of
                            the applicable data. In addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection,
                            Sale, retention, and use of your PI as permitted by the CCPA; such offers may result in
                            reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels. The material aspects of any financial
                            incentive will be explained and described in its program terms. For details of our current
                            financial incentive program and its terms, including how to opt-in or withdraw your opt-in,
                            program benefits, refer to DineRewards Terms and Conditions. </p>
                        <p>Please note that participating in incentive programs is entirely optional; participants
                            affirmatively opt into the program, and can opt out of the program (i.e., terminate
                            participation and forgo the ongoing incentives) by following the instructions in the program’s
                            description and terms. We may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting a
                            notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above, so check them regularly. </p>
