                                give you access to your Rewards Account. The Program Website itself is governed by separate

                                your rights and obligations with respect to the Program Website. Certain features or

                                someone else. You agree not to use another person’s username, password or online profile at

                                    <li style="margin: 0px; padding-bottom: 8px;">You agree that you will not take any legal
                                        action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until ten (10) business
                                        days after you send this Demand. If we do not resolve this disagreement to your
                                        satisfaction within ten (10) business days, and you intend on taking legal action,
                                        you agree that you will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration
                                        Association (the “AAA”). Please note that for any such filing of a demand for
                                        arbitration, you must affect proper service under the rules of the AAA, and that
                                        notice to the Notice Address may not suffice. If, for any reason, the AAA is unable
                                        to provide the arbitration, you may file your case with any national arbitration
                                        company. The arbitrator shall apply the AAA Consumer-Related Disputes Supplementary
                                        Procedure as effective September 15, 2005. You agree that the arbitrator will have
                                        sole and exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute you have with us. You understand
                                        that the Federal Arbitration Act allows for the enforcement of arbitration

                                        a jury or a state or federal judge. You agree that if you do sue us in state or
                                        federal court, and we bring a successful motion to compel arbitration, you must pay

                                        You agree that you will not file a class action or collective action against us, and
