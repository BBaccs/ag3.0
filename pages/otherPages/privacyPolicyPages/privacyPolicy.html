                        Information collected in this manner may include IP addresses, device identifiers, browser
                        characteristics, operating system details, language preferences, referring URLs, length of

                        accept cookies by default, but you may be able to set your browser to notify you before you
                        receive a cookie or to remove or reject cookies. Please note that if you disable cookies, you

                        time and across online services and devices. </p>

                    <p>We may use certain web analytics services, for example, Google Analytics, to help us understand
                        and analyze how visitors use the Services and to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet.
                        We’ve implemented Google Analytics Advertising Features such as remarketing with analytics,
                        interest-based advertising, demographics and interests reporting, user segment analysis,
                        impression reporting. We and third-party vendors may use first-party cookies or other
                        first-party identifiers as well as third-party cookies or other third-party identifiers to
                        deliver advertisements, create a profile of you, measure your interests, detect your
                        demographics, detect your location, personalize content, or create an account for management of
                        our customer loyalty program. </p>

                    <p>Certain features of the Services may permit you to initiate interactions between the Services and
                        other parties, such as social networks (for example, to log in to a restaurant’s WiFi network or
                        invite friends to join Dine Rewards). Using these features may allow both BBI and the other
                        service to access certain information about your use of our Services and theirs, including
                        personal information. You should review the terms, policies, and settings of those third-party

                    <h3 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Sweepstakes, Contests, and Other Promotions </h3>

                    <p>We may operate sweepstakes, contests, raffles, and similar promotions (each, a “Promotion”)
                        jointly sponsored or offered by other parties; participating in these Promotions may require you
                        to submit certain personal information. If you choose to participate in a Promotion, your
                        personal information may be disclosed to other parties as described in the terms applicable to
                        that Promotion. Insofar as the terms applicable to a particular Promotion conflict with this
                        Privacy Policy, the terms applicable to the Promotion shall control. </p>

                    <h3 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Linked Websites</h3>
                    <p>The Services may include links to other websites that are not owned or operated by BBI. This
                        Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites, which may have their own privacy policies or
                        notices that you should review to understand how they may collect, use, or disclose your
                        personal information. BBI is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any linked
                        websites that are operated by third parties. </p>

                    <p>The Services also may provide links to other websites operated by BBI or our subsidiaries. Unless
                        indicated otherwise, these websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. For information on
                        how these websites may collect, use, or disclose your personal information, we encourage you to
                        review the privacy policies posted on the linked websites. </p>
                    <h3 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Security </h3>
                    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect personal information from loss, theft, misuse,
                        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the
                        Internet and digital storage are not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of
                        your information collected through the Services. </p>

                    <h3 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Communication preferences and marketing.</h3>
                    <p>If you do not wish to receive marketing emails from us, you can opt out of future marketing
                        emails by following the instructions provided in the marketing emails. Opting out of marketing
                        emails will not affect our administrative emails to you (e.g., emails about your transactions or
                        policy changes).</p>
                    <p>We only send text messages to those who have expressly opted-in to receiving communications by
                        text message. If you no longer wish to receive text messages from us, you can opt out of future
                        text messages by replying to one of our text messages with the word “Stop.” </p>

                    <p>Additionally, you may request to stop receiving promotional materials by contacting us at <a

                    </h3>
                    <p>If you are a registered user of the Services, you may review and change certain personal
                        information (e.g., email, password, phone number, payment information) at any time by accessing
                        your account online. </p>


                    <h3 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Location tracking.</h3>
                    <p>You may be able to enable or disable location tracking through the Apps by adjusting the
                        permissions in your account or device settings. Be aware that if GPS precise location services
                        are disabled, other means of establishing or estimating location (e.g., connecting to or
                        proximity to WiFi, Bluetooth, beacons, or our networks) may persist. Enabling location tracking
                        may enable an App to track your location in the background, which may decrease battery life.</p>
                    <h3 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">App permissions. </h3>
                    <p>You may be able to enable or disable certain features (e.g., allowing the Apps to read, modify,
                        or delete the contents of your USB storage; take pictures and videos; view WiFi connection) by
                        adjusting the permissions in your device settings.</p>

                    <h3 class="privacy-policy-sub-text">Uninstallation.</h3>
                    <p>If you want to terminate our ability to obtain information from you through the Apps, you may
                        uninstall the Apps from your device. </p>
